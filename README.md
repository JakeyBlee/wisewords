# WiseWords Random Sentence Generator

## Description
This project was a quick challenge on the coding platform Codecademy as an introduction to JavaScript. The blurb was to write a script that iterated through a number of arrays to return a randomly generated sentence. I completed this through Visual Code Studio, executing the code through Node. Following this I quickly added some simple HTML and CSS styling to allow code execution through a browser with a button click.

## Features
By pressing the button on the webpage a random sentence will be generated by combining randomly selected items from a number of different string arrays.

## Technologies
This small webpage uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
